							<p>When Covid-19 struck in the middle of 2020, it only brought chaos to our lives on all levels. We have now reached a new juncture in our global political and economic momentum. Several countries have adopted new adaptation strategies in fighting the pandemic in the year 2021, one year after the infamous virus struck. Many countries implement adaptation methods such as making vaccines available to their citizens through thorough distribution. In an effort to make citizens more resilient to this outbreak, vaccines are distributed to the citizens. So began the race between industrialized countries to produce vaccines in mass quantities. While Indonesia doesn't self-produce vaccines, the country proclaimed itself to be the fourth country to do mass vaccinations among its citizens.</p>
                            <p>As a result of this mechanism inside Indonesia, the Indonesian Government has developed the policy to address the prevalent Covid-19 Pandemic, called PEN or the National Economic Recover Policy, outlined in Government Regulation Number 23 of 2020. The implementation of PEN in 2021 aims to focus on at least three items, among them the distribution of vaccines, recovery kits, and regulatory reform. </p>
                            <p>Through these policies, business continuity is ensured through the amendment of Financial Services Authority Regulation Number 11/POJK as stated in POJK No.48/POJK.03/2020. In the policy issued by the EC on 03/2020 concerning the use of national economic stimulus as a countercyclical policy in response to the Coronavirus outbreak of 2019, the objective is to provide relief to debtors through credit relaxation. A further objective of Structural Reform is to accelerate foreign investment into Indonesia through the development of policies and arrangements through Law 11 of 2020 concerning Job Creation.</p>
                            <p>In order to ensure the safety and security of people and humanity, we must address the elephant in the room - Whether Indonesia and the international community are doing enough. The key message from the International Conference is highlighted by this exhortation. As discussed above, Human Security is both development and protection, which encompasses widespread and non-military security concerns. During 1990, the United Nations programmed the concept of "Human Development" which consists of healthcare, education, and the economics of individuals as the main components of development. "Human Security," freedom from fear, and the freedom of desires along with this concept were then added as the cornerstones of this concept. Consequently, we can recognize an important paradigm shift between "security" and "development". Individuals will now take center stage, demonstrating the previously state-centric nature of the previous approach. Comparing this to previous methods, where people did not integrate these two factors, they are now addressing them practically integrated. </p>
                            <p>Nevertheless, the Covid-19 pandemic happened in 2020 and marked a paradigm shift in the security situation. World is becoming more and more realistic and isolated after the war of words begins. Traditional defense mechanisms are unable to control this new enemy, which directly attacks the three components of Human Security, namely Health, Education, and Income.</p>
                            <p>Human Security in a Pandemic Situation will be the topic of the International Conference on "Human Security and Pandemics". Academics, scholars, and researchers from around the world will come together to discuss the latest trends, developments, and challenges in this field.</p>
